                                                    We have formulated rules and regulations, enacted with the support of cricket clubs and teams in DFW area, to provide a robust framework for leagues and our operations management. Our bylaws specify the qualifications, rights, responsibilities and liabilities
                                                    of membership, and the powers, duties, and grounds for discipline action to manage the league transparently and effectively. It offers clear guidance and allow us to leverage a standardized approach
                                                    to raise the quality of games through common code of conduct. It offers an official rule book to teams, players, umpires and DCL Management to govern the league including unknown conditions and variables
                                                    such as unpredictable weather impact during league matches.

                                                <p>
                                                    DCL Bylaws are distributed to each league team during enrollment in every season. Each club executive, the team captain or team manager are responsible to share it with each player in the team. This rulebook serves as a bible or playbook for DCL league
                                                    for all seasons. DCL umpires are certified to officiate the games as per rulebook. Disputes, if any, are resolved by referring to it. You can download it by clicking on the document below:
