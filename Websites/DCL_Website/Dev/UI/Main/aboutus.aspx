                                                for the game of cricket. We take time out of our weekend chores to get together
                                                and practice our cricketing skills. While doing so we noticed a lot of other cricket
                                                players doing the same and got opportunities to play matches with them.

                                                <br />
                                                This lead to the idea of forming a league which would bring all the cricket teams
                                                who play taped tennis ball cricket. This would provide an opportunity for all the
                                                teams to play more organized cricket and the league to hold regular seasons and
                                                tournaments. The teams in the league share the following points:

                                        This website is the starting symbol for the implementation of this idea. This website
                                        provides all the teams a presence on the internet. They can store their players
                                        statistics and match statistics making it accessible to everyone on the internet.
                                        This provides the teams with more professional look and feel.
